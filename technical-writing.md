# Motivation

Excuses: `I'm a developer, not a writer.`, `I don't have time.`, `No one reads documentation.`, `I already know how it works.`
Prerequisites: `Understands the product`, `Intelligent`, `Good writing skills`, `Command of the English language`
Contra: `Too close to the product`, `Write from developer's perspective, not the user's`, `Hard to remove bias and assumptions`
Pro: `Marketing: you have to sell your product`, `Gets the information out of your head, people will stop asking you for it`, `Gets the team on the same page`, `Reduces support calls makes users happier`, `An auditor might want to know`, `It's a direct reflection of you`
Agile Manifesto: `Working software over comprehensive documentation` != `Throw documentation out`
Guideline: `Essential: just barely good enough detail`, `Valuable: benefit of having doc > cost of creating/maintain`, `Timely: done in a just-in-time manner when needed`

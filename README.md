* 👋 Hi, I’m suadin :-).
* 👀 I’m interested in learning new stuff around full-stack development.
* 🌱 I’m currently learning blazor web-assemblies and how to setup lightweight and cheep ci/cd
  * suadin/suadin.de is my first ✨blazor✨ project. I plan to implement stuff from older times like simple games or new ideas like knowledge card collections.
  * suadin/infrastructure documents ✨server✨ and ✨ci/cd✨ part with aim to be as simple & reusable as possible.
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on best practises, am open for potential improvements.
* 📫 How to reach me? Maybe you can find me in suadin.de teamspeak :-). But via mail is as well ok.
